> Welcome to my website! I am primarily self-taught Watercolour artist living in Berkshire.  I love the medium because of its immediacy and wonderful luminosity. I attempt different styles and techniques and find myself drawn to the impressionistic style of painting.  I enjoy painting different subjects like landscapes, citiscape, flora and fauna. Any subject with varying degrees of contrast and tonal values attract me. I am always in the search for a 'perfect' subject specially during my travels . I enjoy working from photo references as well as plein air painting. I feel inspired by watercolour painters of today and their different styles. I am a member of  Art Societies in my area which are thriving and active societies and have frequent exhibitions, demos and workshops.
